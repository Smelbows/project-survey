Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
Blue

- Your site should follow accessibility guidelines

Red
- Use a form element you haven't tried before (such as a [range slider](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp)) and connect it to React state. You can find a list of input types [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp).


Black      
        
- Visualize to the user how far through the survey they are, and how much is left, by creating a progress bar
- Use Regex validation for some input on your survey
- Show different questions depending on the answer to a specific question

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
